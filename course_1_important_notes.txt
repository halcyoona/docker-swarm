DTR (Docker Trusted Registry)
UCP (Universal Control Plane)

Architecture:
Docker CLI (client)
Dockerd (server)
Rest API


Docker uses types of namespaces:
process
mount
network
IPC
user


Docker control groups
1)CPU limits       
2)CPU reservations
-c, --cpu-shares int
3)memory limits
4)memory reservations
-m, --memory bytes


storage driver
are those which control how images and containers are stored on docker host

Docker repository
most common repository is docker hub
create a dockerID on hub.docker.com

To back up docker you have to back following things
    backing up with docker swarm
    systemctl stop docker
    cd /var/lib/docker
    Copy and archive the swarm directory
    systemctl start docker

    backing up the UCP
    some command search it on google

    backing up DTR 
    some command search it on google


    backing up the volume data
    container data should not be stored in the container but stored in the container volumes and that goes to NAS or SAN or even in public cloud 



checking status and important information
    docker status
    docker info
    docker ps
    docker node ls (this will only run in docker manager)


docker logging 
    docker logs containerID


docker common issue
    running docker command with sudo
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    docker version
